REFLECTIONS : WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM ANALYZING YOUR POWER.  TALK ABOUT SOME POTENTIAL TRADEOFFS. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How did you determine your ""days of use"" metric? 
The ""days of use"" metric was established based on the intended operational cycle of the food container. The display is set to stay on for 24 hours, updating from the sensor for only 3 hours daily, with the rest of the time in standby, waiting for user interaction. The sensor enters sleep mode for 6 hours to save power and operates for 3 hours to detect gases, aligning with typical meal times to check for food spoilage. The device remains idle otherwise.What do you think is the optimum size for the battery in your device?
Considering the design requires the device to run for 7 days, a battery capacity of 56224 mAh would be ideal. However, this is quite substantial. A more practical approach might be to use a rechargeable battery with a capacity of 16000 mAh or 24000 mAh, which would be more compatible with the device's size constraints.What hardware/software/cost/effort tradeoffs could you make to improve the user experience? To enhance user experience and manage costs effectively, it might be wise to adjust the hardware's operating time. This could involve allowing the user to manually switch the sensor and display on and off, which conserves power. This manual control is beneficial as the device may not be needed continuously throughout the day or when there are no leftovers to monitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
